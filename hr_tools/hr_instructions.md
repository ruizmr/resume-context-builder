# Instructions for HR Candidate Context Packaging

Focus on candidate-relevant details:

- Roles, companies, dates, locations
- Education, certifications, clear skill taxonomy (technical + soft)
- Technologies, tools, methodologies actually used
- Measurable achievements (metrics, impact, scope)
- Leadership, collaboration, cross-functional work
- Flag gaps (>6 months) and inconsistencies

Formatting:

- Use concise bullet points per candidate
- Preserve headings per candidate and the original relative file path
- Exclude images, raw data tables, and repetitive boilerplate
- Keep the output compact and copy-paste friendly
